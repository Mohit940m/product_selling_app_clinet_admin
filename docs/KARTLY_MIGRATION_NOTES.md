# Kartly Migration Notes — Seller Admin

Running log kept alongside `docs/KARTLY_UI_PLAN.md`. Record decisions and
baselines here as each phase completes; do not duplicate plan content.

## Phase 0 — Audit baseline (recorded before any code changes)

### 0.1.1 — Confirmed finding

`tailwind.config.js` is not read by Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`, no
`@config` directive in `src/index.css`). Legacy token classes render as
unstyled utilities — same root cause as the user client before its
migration.

### 0.1.2 — Legacy token class inventory (before)

```
grep -rnoE "(bg|text|border|from|to|via)-(primary|secondary|accent|background|text)\b" src/
```

| Class | Count |
|---|---|
| `text-text` | 100 |
| `text-accent` | 43 |
| `bg-secondary` | 33 |
| `text-primary` | 31 |
| `border-primary` | 18 |
| `bg-background` | 10 |
| `bg-primary` | 6 |
| **Total** | **241** |

Per file (top): `DashboardPage.tsx` 32, `OffersPage.tsx` 24, `SignUpPage.tsx`
19, `AddProductPage.tsx` 17, `LoginPage.tsx` 16, `ProductListPage.tsx` 14,
`EditProductPage.tsx` 12, `ShippingConfigPage.tsx` 10, `OrderListPage.tsx`
10, `ProductDetailsPage.tsx` 8, `Header.tsx` 8, plus small hits in
`MetricCard.tsx`, `Card.tsx`, and the five icon components under
`src/assets/icons/`.

This is the "before" baseline for Phase 7.1.1's re-run of the same grep
(with the ambiguity fix — see the user client's notes on why "accent"
alone can't be the check once the new `--color-accent` token exists).

### 0.2 — Prerequisites

- `npm install` already satisfied (node_modules present).
- `.env` present with `VITE_SERVER_URL` and `VITE_PORT=5203`.
- Baseline build: `npm run build` — clean.
  ```

  ✓ built in 1.59s
  ```
- Baseline `npm run lint` — **not** clean, pre-existing and unrelated to
  this migration:
  - `OffersPage.tsx:57` — `useState<BundleItem[]>([{ id: Date.now(), ... }])`
    calls `Date.now()` directly in the initializer expression, which the
    React Compiler / eslint-plugin-react-hooks purity rule flags as an
    impure call during render. Pre-existing bug, not introduced by this
    migration. Will fix opportunistically when `OffersPage.tsx` is
    restyled in Phase 4.8, using `useState(() => [{ id: Date.now(), ... }])`
    (lazy initializer) instead.
  - `ProductListPage.tsx:67` — missing `loadProducts` in a `useEffect` dep
    array (pre-existing `exhaustive-deps` warning, not an error).
- `.env` also present; no `.env.example` existed for this app before —
  added one at the same time as the user client's, when the Kartly
  migration reaches feature flags for this app (none currently apply to
  admin — the flag is user-client-only).

### 0.2.4 — Prototype read

`kartly-ecommerce-template-kit/project/Kartly Commerce Kit.dc.html` — the
Admin tab (706-818) and Components tab (820-1045) — read in full during
plan authoring, plus reused from the user client's Phase 0 read of the
full prototype (tokens, keyframes, `renderVals()` data block).

Phase 0 complete.
